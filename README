Overview
--------

Avail.pm is a Perl module that contains code to calculate the time remaining
within a given time interval.  The only exported function is timeAvailable.

timeAvailable() compares the current day and time with the specified time
interval and returns the number of minutes remaining or 0 if no time remains.
The time interval used by timeAvailable() is passed in as three parameters: starting time, ending time, and a day mask.
